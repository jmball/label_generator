TROUBLESHOOTING

Problem: The program closes immediately when I try to run it.

Solution: You probably haven't run AutoCAD before so are missing the user folder. Run it once (Start -> All Programs -> Autodesk -> AutoCAD Mechanical 2017 - English -> AutoCAD 2017), accept all defaults and click "OK" at every prompt, then close it again. Start again from step 1. above.
